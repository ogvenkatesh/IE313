Instructions for running our code:
Our code should be run in python 3.
You will need the following packages: pandas, numpy, scipy, gmplot.
All should available through Anaconda except gmplot, which you can add to your python install separately.
We ran our code in Atom using Hydrogen, and in Idle. You can also use another environment of your choice.
These data (.csv) files should be contained in the same directory as the python script for each size dataset you choose .
In the beginning of the code, change the value of size to 'tiny' 'small' or 'medium' to choose a data set. 
If the data files do not load, you may need to use the full file path on your computer.
Running the full script should lead to the creation of a text file and an HTML file in the same directory.
The text file is a csv style formatted file with PLs and their values (small, medium, large, or none).
At the end of the text file, there is a printed value of our total cost. 
This must be deleted if you would like to "read in" our solution as a csv.
The HTML file is a gmplot output that depicts our solution in google maps form.
Active PLs are shown in different colored markers for different sizes (green for small, blue for medium, and orange for large).
